      <h3>about</h3>
      MyFaves was a collaborative project for Southern Methodist University students Matthew Brannick, Bill Casey, Joshua DeVinney, Drew Jackson, T.J. Moats, and Devin Mullennix. It involved implenting everything that they learned in their Databases and GUI classes and then some. They invested countless man-hours into this project and are pleased to present their results. This website is only one part of the entire project as it also involved using a MySQL database, Apache Tomcat servlets, and Java Swing libraries for a three-tiered software architecture with multiple clients.
